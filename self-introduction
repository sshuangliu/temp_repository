my name is sam, I have been working on network field for the past 7 years, currently, I work for XYZ as a senior nework engineer
I graduated from a ABC University with a Bachelor's degree in 2014, I major in network engineering , I got my first CCIE in 2017
I started off my carre as a network engineer with a local system  intergration company ,at that company
I was in charge of setting up new office network or campus network for customers
I was in that job for more than 2 years
then I got the opportunity to be a network engineer for ECCOM company base on Beijing which has a good reputation in networking industry in China, 
I joined the financial network team which was responsible for datacenter network infrastructure of bank customers, incloud top 4 bank in china, like BOC ICBC,
I was assigned by(to) BOC group, we have 10 members at BOC group
BOC has three data centers in two locations
the biggest one is in our changer
we used cisco NEXUS and ASA most
during my time here, not more than one year later, I undertook most of the critical network projects, like N7K software  and hardware upgrades, Here are 20 pairs of equipment, also incloud set up new N7K N5K nodes, line/Supervisor card
I always led technical share session within the team 
for a positive reason, for further development and learning, so I went to another company,call digital china information, and a big ICT company is our client ,so my duties is to maintain the network infuresture of than company ,
they used MPLS L3 VPN, so I also have hands-on expersice on MPLS L3 VPN option B ,but there are not really much things I need to do , I don't think they really need this position, so, after 4 mouths, I got a change to worked for a public cloud service provider,UCLOUD,
I am really excited for this new job, This is really a challenging job
public cloud service provider, they have a very large scal network infrastructure distributed around the world, although it is not as big as aws, azure and alicoud, but big enougth,
they used different network architecture and network tech stack, there are different hardware,different NOS,different route protocol,and so on, it's toally different compare to traditional network,like bank network
the company is a devoloping company ,during my time here, I involved and undertook several lan/man/wan projects independently
I learn a lot from that, but all network changes are critital, we have to work at midnight ,we always work overtime
so quit 
After a few months of rest, I joined ABC company
during those months, I taught myself python and Developed network tools in python
I used it for my project now.
